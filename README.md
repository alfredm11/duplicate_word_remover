Duplicate Word Remover

From the title itself this is a simple duplicate remover from a text documents. It remove duplicates regardless of letter case.
As a transcriptionist, I created this to help me speed up my job in removing duplicate words. I used RegEx in Python for searching and subtituting duplicate words.
